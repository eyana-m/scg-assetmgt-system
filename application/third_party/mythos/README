Mythos
Developed by Zeaple, Inc.


[INSTALLATION]

1. Copy the mythos folder in application/third_party

2. Open application/config/config.php and make the following changes:
	- Change the $autoload['packages'] to:
		$autoload['packages'] = array(APPPATH.'third_party/mythos/');
	- Add 'mythos' in the $autoload['libraries']

3. Move/Copy the files found in application/third_party/mythos/core to application/core
	- Note: Fixes some of CI's bugs when using third-party packages.

4. Move/Copy the resources folder to the root folder of your CI installation. Call the CSS and Javascript files in your template.

5. Move/Copy config/mythos.php to your CI application's config folder (application/config).


[NOTES]

1. If you are to add functionality to a library specific to the system you are making, just extend the original Mythos library. This allows you to upgrade your Mythos package without having any conflicts with your code.

2. You may edit the Mythos files for bug fixes and enhancements. Please commit them and notify the development team regarding the bug fixe or enhancement.

3. Mythos libraries use the subclass_prefix "MYTHOS_".

4. You can extend all libraries except MYTHOS_Pagination and MYTHOS_Form_validation (limitation of CI: cannot extend a third-party library which extends a core CI library).

5. Calling Mythos files should be done by either autoloading using the config/mythos.php or by calling the load functions of the Mythos class (do not use CI's loader).

	Example:
	$this->mythos->library('captcha'); // RIGHT
	$this->load->library('captcha'); // WRONG

6. If you copied the Mythos config file into your application's config folder, CI will ignore the original Mythos config file.
